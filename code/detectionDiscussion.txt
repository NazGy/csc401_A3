There is a slight trend with the hidden size. When then hidden size is increase, the accuracy increases. This
is because a larger hidden size means more learnable parameters, and thus, a potential better representation
of the training data. However, it seems like the accuracy converges at hidden size 10, as any more increase will keep it at the same
accuracy.
